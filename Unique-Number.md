# Article for The Unique Number Game by Team 46
I am Ahamauefule Ridely a Computer Engineering student in Sasckatchewan Politechnic College, Regina. I participated in the Umoja 3 bounty hack and I was introduced into this Bounty Hack by my elder brother who was one of the winners of the previous WWC reach hackathon. 

This is my first experience in a virtual 6 week hackathon and I am happy that I completed my projects in time and I learnt alot during the competion.

My project was a unique number guessing game where a predetermined range of numbers are generated and the players have to guess a unique number to  win or lose the game, the first player to get a unique number wins the game and gets his wager and the wager of his opponent.

During the start of the hackathon I was skeptical and somewhat scared of the competion while i was trying to finialize the tutorial but my brother aka my mentor motivated me to continue and assured me that everything would come together at the end and I am so glad I took his advice cause I was able to complete my Dapp at the end of it all, which is a great accomplishment for me and an addition to my portfolio.

During the hack I surfed the documentations and the reach lang github to get ideas and understanding about some areas in reach such as the while loop, the use of arrays in reach and also the integration of my backend and frontend which I used a react boilerplate that made my work easier and helped me understand a lot better.

During the hack I had problems understanding the use of commitments and the syntax behind them but my mentor was able to help me out there.

The most challenging obstacle I had to face was integrating my frontend with the backend but a reach react boilerplate was shared to all of us and it helped  me understand how to convert my console dapp to a web dapp.

After the integration part the speed, efficency and security of reach really impressed me, I realized how reach allows developers  to focus on getting their functionalities and the specs of thier  apps without bothering about other problems like deploying and auditing their their smart contracts.

If I had more time to add and perfect my Dapp I would likely redesign my frontend and add some little functionalites to my dapp.

At the end of this hack I would be using my project in this hack as my term project, discussing about the advantages of decentralized applications and  how reach helps make blockchain development 10 times easier.
I also learnt a lot from  the previous bear hacks, that is no doubt one of the solid grounds that helped me complete my project and learn a whole lot about reach.

My humble appreciation to Nicholas Stanford for consistently being there to answer all my questions, my mentor for introducing  me to Reach and guiding me throughout this hackathon and our  discord community for answering all our questions and sharing useful documentations that led to my sucsess.
